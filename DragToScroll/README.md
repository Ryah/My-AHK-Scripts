# DragToScroll

DragToScroll.ahk allows you to scroll any window or control by right clicking (RButton) and dragging the mouse. It works very similarly to the "Hand Tool" in Adobe products, such as Adobe PDF Reader. It will not interfere with normal RButton behavior. The 'hold' key is configurable, so it doesn't have to be right click. You can choose any key (mouse or keyboard) that you want. Only activated when clicking and dragging. This works great for example with the Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse since this trackball has no scroll wheel.  

This is an updated version from the older script found [here](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/55289-dragtoscroll-universal-drag-flingflick-scrolling/). I fixed some bugs and added some features, and changed the version number from 2.4 to 2.5  

### Usage
1. Download and Install AutoHotkey
2. Download .zip of this repository and extract
3. Run `DragToScroll.ahk`

### Configuration
I don't use the Gui interface (which writes to .ini files) to change the settings, but you could.  
I prefer to just edit the settings directly at the top of the .ahk script.
