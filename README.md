# AHK Scripts

Just a backup of my AHK scripts I use for my work as a Video Editor.

Any scripts or libraries I didn't make will be listed below or in their respective repos (i.e. [LiveWindows v3](https://github.com/Ryah/Live-Windows-3.0)).


## Script List

	  <b>AHK Startup</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Starts up all of my scripts and hides their tray icon. Very useful for organization and keeping my tray tidy.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Hotkey Help</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Automatically scans active scripts for hotkeys and shows them in a nice little dialog box. (Win + F1 to activate)
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Single file 2nd-Keyboard script</b>
	 </summary>

  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>

	  <b>LiveWindows 3.0</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 <a href="https://github.com/Ryah/Live-Windows-3.0">My updated LiveWindows script</a>. Makes a
	 thumbnail overlay of any window for monitoring.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Draft Organizer</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Watches my draft folder for any new drafts encoded from my master copy via Adobe Media Encoder. Once
	 a new draft is detected and finished encoding, it renames the draft with a timestamp and organizes
	 it by filename in it's own subfolder.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>PREMIERE BUG FIX: for stubborn hot text</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 TaranVH Bugfix. Self explanitory.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	 <b>PREMIERE MOD: Right click timeline to move playhead</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 TaranVH Mod. Self explanitory.

 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Tilt Wheel Back-Forward</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Can't install Logitech G502 mouse driver without admin rights and I'm too socially awkward to ask IT
	 so this was my solution. Just sends the browser forward/back input when I tilt the mouse wheel.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Mouse DoubleClick Fix</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Said G502 is also starting to die so this just blocks the doubleclick input if it clicks too fast.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

  <tbody>
	<tr>
	<td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Drag to Scroll</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Since I use a Wacom tablet without Wacom drivers (see socially awkward comment in Tilt Wheel script description), this allows me to drag my mouse to scroll while holding MButton and LButton. One of my sylus buttons is bound to MButton, and I can just drag on the tablet to scroll.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>
 	<details>
 	 <summary>
 	  <b>iswitchw</b>
 	 </summary>
 	 <hr>
 	 Quick fuzzy find-as-you-type searching and selection of open windows
 	</details>
    </td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Desktop Cycle</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Cycles through Virtal Desktops with a single button.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>ShrinkWindow</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Much faster version of LiveWindows but with mutli-window support and lack of opacity/resize. Only problem is, it doesn't work for a lot of my windows and only shows a black screen.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>VLC Pause on Click</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 This should just be a native VLC option at this point
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>CAPshift</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 One of the most useful scripts I have. CAPshift creates a minuscule delay so that the capslock key can't just be knocked by mistake whilst typing, and must be held for x milliseconds to activate. Also if capslock is held for a longer period of time, it displays a menu that extends the caps lock key.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>

 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>
	<details>
	 <summary>
	  <b>Rebinds</b>
	 </summary>
	 <hr>
	 Just Misc Macros that were too small for a single file.
	</details>
   </td>
  </tr>
