# AHK Scripts

Just a backup of my AHK scrips I use for my work as a Video Editor.

Any scripts or libraries I didn't make will be listed below or in their respective repos (i.e. [LiveWindows v3](https://github.com/Ryah/Live-Windows-3.0)).

     <hr>
     Watches my draft folder for any new drafts encoded from my master copy via Adobe Media Encoder. Once
     a new draft is detected and finished encoding, it renames the draft with a timestamp and organizes
     it by filename in it's own subfolder.

     </summary>
     <hr>
     Can't install Logitech G502 mouse driver without admin rights and I'm too socially awkward to ask IT
     so this was my solution. Just sends the browser forward/back input when I tilt the mouse wheel.

      <b>Mouse DoubleClick Fix:</b>
     </summary>
     <hr>
     Said G502 is also starting to die so this just blocks the doubleclick input if it clicks too fast.
