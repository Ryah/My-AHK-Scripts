# AHK Scripts

Just a backup of my AHK scrips I use for my work as a Video Editor.

Any scripts or libraries I didn't make will be listed below or in their respective repos (i.e. [LiveWindows v3](https://github.com/Ryah/Live-Windows-3.0)).

     Watches my draft folder for any new drafts encoded from my master copy via Adobe Media Encoder. Once
     a new draft is detected and finished encoding, it renames the draft with a timestamp and organizes
     it by filename in it's own subfolder.

     Can't install Logitech G502 mouse driver without admin rights and I'm too socially awkward to ask IT

     Said G502 is also starting to die so this just blocks the doubleclick input if it clicks too fast.
