# AHK Scripts

Just a backup of my AHK scrips I use for my work as a Video Editor.

Any scripts or libraries I didn't make will be listed below or in their respective repos (i.e. [LiveWindows v3](https://github.com/Ryah/Live-Windows-3.0)).


## Script List
* Single file 2nd-Keyboard script 
  * TaranVH's Script modified to work for my uses. Also completely portable with no dependencies.
  
* LiveWindows 3.0
  * [My updated LiveWindows script](https://github.com/Ryah/Live-Windows-3.0). Makes a thumbnail overlay of any window for monitoring.
  
* Draft Organizer
  * Watches my draft folder for any new drafts encoded from my master copy via Adobe Media Encoder. Once a new draft is detected and finished encoding, it renames the draft with a timestamp and organizes it by filename in it's own subfolder.
